It consists of all-versus-all protein-dimer interactions predicted with AlphaFold Multimer. These predictions were generated for the herpes viruses HSV-1, HCMV and KSHV, resulting in AlphaFold predicted protein-protein interaction networks.
These networks can be analysed with `degree_barplot.py` and `topology.py` found in this repository.

`degree_barplot.py` gives a simple plot of the node degree (i.e. number of dimer-interactions) for each protein found in the network.
`topology.py` calculates 12 different centrality measures for each protein and performs PCA to separate proteins based on their centrality scores in 2D space. k-means clustering is applied to find groups of proteins with similar centrality scores.
In a next step, groupings like e.g. "is essential in cell culture" or "is a known drug target" can be overlayed to investigate if proteins in these categories have a distinct topology.
